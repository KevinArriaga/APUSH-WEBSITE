  <h1 id="Neel">13th Admendment </h1>
  <p id="BLOODYHEL">Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

- By the end of the Civil War, Lincolnâ€™s goal was to finally abolish slavery in America. Ratified in 1865, the 13th amendment made all black persons free.
</p">

<h1 id="Neel">14th Amendment</h1>
<p id ="BLOODYHEL">All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

- The 14th amendment granted citizenship to all people including blacks and guaranteed all citizens equal protection of the law. This law would become the basis for many Supreme Court decisions that helped establish civil and legal rights for African Americans.
</p>

<h1 id="Neel">15th Amendment</h1>
<p id="BLOODYHEL">The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

- To further reinforce the rights of blacks, Congress passed the 15th amendment allowing all black to be able to vote. No reason could allow any state to go against this law even though the South got away with it for many years after this amendment was passed.</p>
