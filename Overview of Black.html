  <h1 id="Neel">Black Codes</h1>
  <p id="BLOODYHEL"> Black codes were restrictive laws that the South created after the Civil War to counter the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments by limiting the rights that African Americans could exercise.

Some Examples include:
- Under black codes, many states required blacks to sign yearly labor contracts; if they refused, they risked being arrested, fined and forced into unpaid labor.

- Many states created literacy tests which blacks had to pass so that they would be able to vote which ultimately made it impossible for them to exercise their 15th amendment.

- Another way to restrict African Americans’ 15th amendment was by forcing them to pay very high taxes to vote which no one would have the money for.   

- The Grandfather Clause was another law enacted by the South to limit the freedoms of 
Blacks. This basically gave the status of a slave back to all blacks because it stated “if your grandfather was not a free man than neither are you” which affected most blacks since their ancestors were all slaves.</p>

<h1 id="Neel">KKK/Lynchings</h1>
<p id="BLOODYHEL">The KKK rose in after the Civil War and its member were mostly white Southerners that tried to intimidate immigrants and African Americans through the use of violence. One common form of violence directed at blacks were the lynchings that occured from the late 19th century up to the mid 20th century.</p>
